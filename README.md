# Web Scraper
Application to scrap the Urania Basket's website.  This repo has been built in reference to the CODERIT's Python challenges.

To run the application please download the repo on your local machine by pasting on your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/stepyt/news-scraper.git`

Then navigate inside the `src` folder:

`cd news-scraper/scr/`

And then run the application:

`python3 scraper.py`

The code will generate a `.csv` file in the root directory.

Content of the files:
1. `NEWS.csv`: a .csv file containing the scraped news.
2. `requirements.txt`: a file used to build the virtual environment with all the required libraries.
3. `src/scraper.py`: the source code of the application.

The repository contains also a Jupyter notebook `/notebook/Tutorial.ipynb` with detailed steps of the application implementation.
